Hey, you ever wanted to build a sort of custom terminal-like thingy? Well, I have - a couple of times actually - so I have decided to create this python package in order to finally stop re-writing code all the time.

So yeah, this is a package that allows you to create that custom terminal-like thingy. It's pretty simple to use, and it's pretty simple to extend. I am planning on including a few examples in the [`examples`](examples) folder, so you can check those out if you want to.

## ðŸ‘· Installation

Installation will be much easier in the future, once I publish this on PyPI, but for now, you can install it by cloning this repository and running the following in the root project directory:

```bash
pip install .
```
